###################### Slim To ERB ############################

I don't hate slim, but its a real pain :p 

i got a project that was all written in slim, and i had to convert it
into erb.. for to make changes. so i got this little script for to help convert slim to erb. 
anyways here is how it works. 


you need 
1: 
gem install slim-rails
 
once you have that gem installed. 

cd into YourProject/app/views folder, where your slim files live.

2:
Download Script.sh file. 

3. 

bash script.sh 

wait for few moments. 

if necessory.. delete your slim files.
you are done :) enjoy ..
